The fo_shizzle method takes in a string and returns the same string with lower case s' replaced with z's except when the s is at the beginning of a word or is capitalized.

Divide the string into letters in a an array and check to see if it's an s
if it is an s then we need to check if it's the first letter in the word

We'll first split the string into an array of the words and then for each word
we'll split it into letters and ignore the first letter but check each subsequent letter to see if it's capitalized.
